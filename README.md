## Introduction
UltimateClaims is a highly configurable land claiming and protection plugin,
that offers players an easy to use GUI to manage their claims.
UltimateClaims allows you to make it so players are charged for keeping thier claims protected or not,
allows players to manage all their claims from one central GUI that is accessible through the powercell,
allows players to manage what claim members and also visitors can do in their claims,
and allows them to lock their claims so other players can't wander into it.
